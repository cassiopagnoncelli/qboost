## R CMD check Results

### Current Status: 1 ERROR, 1 WARNING, 5 NOTES

### ERROR
- **PDF manual generation fails** - `pdflatex is not available`
  - **Impact**: Low - CRAN builds the PDF manual themselves
  - **Action**: None required - this is a local environment issue

### WARNING
- **LaTeX errors when creating PDF**
  - **Impact**: Low - Related to the ERROR above
  - **Action**: None required - CRAN will handle PDF generation

### NOTES

1. **"Non-standard file/directory found at top level: 'dev'"**
   - **Status**: Added to .Rbuildignore
   - **Action**: Should be resolved in next build

2. **"Unknown, possibly misspelled, fields in DESCRIPTION: '# LazyData'"**
   - **Status**: Fixed - removed commented line
   - **Action**: Resolved

3. **HTML validation problems**
   - **Impact**: Low - These are cosmetic HTML5 validation warnings
   - **Action**: Acceptable for CRAN - these are generated by R's documentation system

4. **"qboost-manual.tex" found in check directory**
   - **Impact**: Low - Temporary build artifact
   - **Action**: Acceptable - CRAN's automated checks handle this

## Pre-Submission Actions

### Required Before Submission

1. **Generate documentation and run clean build and check**
   ```r
   roxygen2::roxygenise()  # Generate documentation
   devtools::check()        # Check package
   ```

2. **Test on multiple platforms** (recommended)
   - Use GitHub Actions or rhub
   - Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Test on R-devel, R-release, R-oldrelease

3. **Check on R-hub** (optional but recommended)
   ```r
   rhub::check_for_cran()
   ```

4. **Win-builder check** (optional but recommended)
   ```r
   devtools::check_win_devel()
   devtools::check_win_release()
   ```

5. **Update cran-comments.md** with actual test results

### Final Checks

- [ ] All examples run without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Vignettes build successfully
- [ ] No write operations to user's home directory
- [ ] No modification of user's .Rprofile or options
- [ ] Package size is reasonable (<5MB)

## Expected CRAN Submission Results

Based on the current check, you should expect:
- **0 ERRORs** (the pdflatex ERROR will not appear on CRAN's systems)
- **0 WARNINGs** (the LaTeX WARNING is local only)
- **0-1 NOTEs** (HTML validation NOTEs are acceptable, dev directory should be excluded)

## Submission Process

When ready to submit:

1. **Build source package**
   ```bash
   R CMD build .
   ```

2. **Final check**
   ```bash
   R CMD check --as-cran qboost_0.4.7.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Submit to CRAN**
   - Visit: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html
   - Upload: qboost_0.4.7.tar.gz
   - Include cran-comments.md content in submission form

4. **Respond to CRAN feedback**
   - CRAN maintainers typically respond within 1-2 weeks
   - Address any feedback promptly
   - Resubmit if necessary

## Notes

- The HTML validation warnings are expected and acceptable
- The PDF manual ERROR is a local environment issue and won't affect CRAN submission
- Make sure to test on win-builder before final submission
- First submissions typically receive more scrutiny - be prepared for feedback
