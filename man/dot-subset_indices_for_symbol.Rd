\title{Subset and remap global indices for a specific symbol}
\usage{
.subset_indices_for_symbol(global_idx, train_idx, val_idx, folds)
}
\arguments{
\item{global_idx}{Integer vector of row indices for this symbol in the full dataset}

\item{train_idx}{Optional global training indices}

\item{val_idx}{Optional global validation indices}

\item{folds}{Optional list of global fold validation indices}
}
\value{
List with symbol-specific train_idx, val_idx, and folds (or NULL)
}
\description{
Takes global dataset indices and remaps them to symbol-specific local indices,
respecting symbol boundaries (never mixing observations between symbols).
