\title{Feature importance for an mqbm model}
\usage{
\method{importance}{mqbm}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted mqbm model object returned by \code{\link{mqbm}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{importance.qbm}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\item{feature}{Feature name}
\item{mean_gain}{Average information gain across all symbol models}
\item{sd_gain}{Standard deviation of information gain across symbols}
\item{n_models}{Number of symbol models where this feature appears}
}
\description{
Aggregates feature importance across all symbol-specific qbm models.
Returns the mean and standard deviation of information gain for each feature,
ranked by mean gain.
}
\details{
For each feature, this function:
\enumerate{
\item Extracts feature importance from each symbol-specific qbm model
\item Computes the mean information gain across all symbols
\item Computes the standard deviation of information gain
\item Counts how many symbol models use this feature
}

Features are ranked by mean information gain in descending order.
Features that don't appear in all symbol models will have their gain
treated as 0 for those models when computing statistics.

# Fit mqbm model
df <- data.frame(
  x1 = rnorm(200),
  x2 = rnorm(200),
  x3 = rnorm(200),
  symbol = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 200, replace = TRUE)

# Get aggregated feature importance
