\title{Extract residuals from a mqbm model}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{mqbm}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted mqbm model object returned by \code{\link{mqbm}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of residuals with length equal to the number of
training observations. Each element is computed as \code{y - fitted},
where \code{fitted} is the predicted quantile from the appropriate
symbol-specific model. Residuals are returned in the same order as the
original training data.
}
\description{
Computes residuals as the difference between observed values and fitted
quantile predictions from the training data. For multi-symbol quantile
regression, residuals are computed separately for each symbol-specific
model and returned in the original training data order.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit a mqbm model with multiple symbols
df <- data.frame(
  x1 = rnorm(200),
  x2 = rnorm(200),
  symbol = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 200, replace = TRUE)
)
df$y <- df$x1 * 0.5 + rnorm(200)
fit <- mqbm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df, tau = 0.5, nrounds = 50)

# Extract residuals
resid <- residuals(fit)
summary(resid)

# Residuals by symbol
tapply(resid, df$symbol, summary)
